# Bank_Project
My portion of the second year group project.
Most of the index page and javascript is mine as well. There is a terrible 
nasty ugly javascript function on th bottom of each page where I tried to
use try catch blocks to build a general purpose function to deal with the different 
page layouts. This was a bad idea, I should change it back. Also some duplicaton of 
functions in the 'iframe' and 'main page' js files but on the plus side there is some
nice associatve array and objectish stuff in there if I remember correctly.
